# DCProblem

This is a tutorial for D.C. programming (Difference of two convex functions) problem. The conventional solution is derived by Taylor expansion.
Stephen Boyd's group has developed a Python package named DCCP to solve the problem efficiently.

This tutorial provides the Matlab and Python programs to solve the power allocation problem in [This Paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6108303).
You can check the codes in [This File](https://github.com/RobertGCNiu/DCProblem/tree/master/Python_and_Matlab_Code).
